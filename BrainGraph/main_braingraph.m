%%    Main code for constructing the voxel-level brain grid

%     Created by: Anjali Tarun
%     Date created: 21 February 2018
%     Based from the original code of Hamid Behjat, Martin Larsson and
%     David Abramian


%     Changes made in the original ODF design of Itturia Medina and HB's code:
%     -- to use whole brain volume instead of WM only
%     -- incorporated structural boost using QA anisotropy
%     -- removes outlier brain voxels to aid in convergence of the
%           eigendecomposition of the Laplacian
